This folder sim_lgcp_estimate_hawkes addresses the simulation of Log-Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP) and estimation using Hawkes processes.

Main Scripts and Data

"simulate_lgcp_estimate_hawkes.R" --> This is the main script. It first provides code to simulate generic data using LGCP. The file "data_from_lgcp_3003.RData"
is an example simulation corresponding to scenario (a) in Section 3.4, specifically the dataset represented in Figure 5(a) of the paper.

Next, the data are estimated using a misspecified Hawkes model (model 1).
The estimation is done using the script "estim_model1_hawkes.R". To estimate data with model 2, it is sufficient to change the triggering function.

"hawkes_data_k_function.RData" contains the data needed to compute the K-functions. These Hawkes data have been simulated using the rejection sampling method implemented in "functions_generate_data_model1_hawkes.R", employing the estimated parameters.
"kas_hawk_G_3003.RData" and "kas_hawk_E_3003.RData" contain the K-functions for Models 1 and 2, respectively, used to replicate Figure 6(a).

Finally, the data generated from the Hawkes process using the estimated parameters for forecasting purposes are "forecast_data_model1.RData". These data are used to represent the predicted intensity.
