This folder simulate_hawkes_estimate_lgcp addresses the simulation of Hawkes processes and their estimation using Log-Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP).

Main Scripts and Data

"simulate_hawkes_estimate_lgcp.R" is the main script. It provides code to simulate generic Hawkes processes using the acceptance-rejection method. The functions necessary for implementing the acceptance-rejection method are in "functions_generate_data_model1_hawkes.R".

The file "data_hawkes_1_002.RData" contains an example of simulated data from scenario (a) in Section 3.1, specifically the dataset represented in Figure 1(a) of the paper.

The file "lgcp_functions.R" contains functions needed to estimate, simulate, and predict using LGCP models.

"data_k_functions_model3_1_002.RData" contains datasets simulated from an LGCP with estimated parameters, used to compute the K-functions (envelopes).

Finally, "forecast_lg_m3_1002.RData" contains the output of the prediction function for Bayesian forecasting under an LGCP model.
